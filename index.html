        <p>Hi and welcome to my website! I'm Jorge Martinez, 26 years old, born and raised in Monterrey.</p>
        <p>I graduated a few years ago from Tecnologico de Monterrey, holding a Bachelor in Mechatronics
        Engineering. After graduation I started working for the next 2 years in different companies such 
        as CNC Industrial and Softel. A year and a half ago I started working full-time on my own snack 
        business, Cornell Snack Lab, and it's been growing steadily since its inception</p>
        <p>Now I'm looking once again to take on the path of programming I since left behind, this time 
        focusing on web development and game development. I know uncharted territories lie ahead, but I'm 
        willing to put all my effort and energies to succeed in these unknown lands. Practice and experience
        can only come after struggling through countless obstacles, so let them come!</p>
